* Leaderboard :
    * The leaderboard will be able to create a graph of the evolution of code efficency depending on the methods and the service list. At the moment, the server_catalog will stay the same.
    * Creating a JSON file that will be used as a database
    * Creation quick functions that whill be launched daily to check the code on GitHub and update the database
    
* Method1 :
    * Optimisation of the actual developped solution
